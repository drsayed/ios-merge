        wss://your_server_address:5443/WebRTCAppEE/websocket
        - streamId: The stream id that you use in your connection. You either play or publish with this stream id.
        - token: If you active one-time token on server side, you should enter token value in here. If one-time token is not activated, just leave empty
        - mode: The Mode of the Client. It should .play, .publish or .join. If it's .play, it means your WebRTC client will play a stream with your streamId
        on the server. If it's .publish, it mean your WebRTC client will publish stream with your stream id.
        - enableDataChannel: Enable or disable data channel on the mobile side. In order to make data channel work, you also need to enable it on server side
